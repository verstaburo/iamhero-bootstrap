                <h3>IMPORTANT NOTE for clarity:</h3>
                <p>Those who have activated their Affiliate Superhero status earn commissions, whereas those who haven’t do not. Affiliates earn commissions on upgrades whether or not the person who upgrades becomes an affiliate or not. Superheroes MUST
                    activate their Affiliate status to earn referral commissions, otherwise they will not earn commissions.... the Affiliate status is not an automatic process when a User Upgrades from Hero to Superhero!</p>
